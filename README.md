# adopt-me
adopt-me uses FrontEnd masters API to create a nice looking React App that has data coming in showing pictures for various different breeds of animals, their name, and location! It is literally an app for adopting animals.

To start adoptMe, you must cd into the adopt-me directory, and then run the command "npm run dev" with no quotations. The adoptMe app will be running on localhost:1234 once this is done.
